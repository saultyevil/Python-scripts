# Python-Scripts

This is a repository containing the Python scripts I have written during my
PhD. Some of these scripts are science related, some are not. Hopefully you,
or someone else, will find some of these useful.

The scripts are in general documented well enough that you should be able to
use them without much issue (I hope).

## Requirements

For most of the scripts nothing special is really required. However, scripts
which are prefixed with py, e.g. py_plot.py, will require my module PyPython, 
which can be found [here](https://github.com/saultyevil/PyPython).
